Minor stuff: 
- add a nice html report
- feature to choose model type in gemini (now you can only choose it for chatgpt) 
- fetching possible model choices form CLI (as I understand the program has the models hardcoded. 
Please make it so that the list of all possible models is fetched form the LLM CLI (gemini CLI and codex) 
and the user may choose from such a list of uptodate current models. Before you check this, please first 
verify whether this can be easily done. If it cannot be doen easily we will drop its not that important.



Finishing touches: 
- write and execute extensive test; 
- redteam it with codex or, possibly, claude code; 
- do a windows executable; move to Tools;
